# HMFAYSAL V2

**[HMFAYSAL V2](http://v2.theevilgenius.tk)** is a two column responsive Jekyll theme by Engineer [Hossain Mohd Faysal](http://hmfaysal.tk) featuring a slide out drawer menu in mobile browsers.

## HMFAYSAL V2 is all about:

* Responsive templates. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers. 
* Minimal embellishments. Content first; other widget nonsense never.
* Large feature images for posts and pages.
* Simple and clear permalink structure.
* [Custom 404 page](http://v2.theevilgenius.tk/404.html) to get you started.
* Stylesheets for Pygments and Coderay [syntax highlighting](http://v2.theevilgenius.tk/articles/code-highlighting-post/) to make your code examples look snazzy.

General notes and suggestions for customizing HMFAYSAL V2 Theme.

## Basic Setup

1. [Install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) if you haven't already.
2. Fork the [Jekyll HMFAYSAL V2 Theme repo](http://github.com/hmfaysal/Jekyll-HMFAYSAL-V2-Theme/)
3. Clone the repo you just forked to your computer.
4. Edit `_config.yml` to personalize your site.
5. Check out the sample posts in `_posts` to see examples for pulling in large feature images, tags, and other YAML data.
6. Read the documentation below for further customization pointers and documentation.

[Demo the Theme](http://v2.theevilgenius.tk)

**Pro-tip:** Delete the `gh-pages` branch after cloning and start fresh by branching off `master`. There is a bunch of garbage in `gh-pages` used for the theme's demo site that I'm guessing you don't want on your site. Also type in `chcp 65001` if the prompt shows UTF-8 or IBM47 error.
