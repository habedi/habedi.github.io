title: Great things i've found
---

I've just decided to share whatever i find interesting on the web with you people, actually there are tonnes of such stuff out there!, still some are more remarkable to me, so without further a due let me show you what i've found so far:

  
* <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian Operating System</a>: You may haven't heard of Debian but using Ubuntu or Kubuntu or Mint, it's just fine but have you ever wondered where and when and how everything that is has been started in the first place!??, plus on a personal level i love Debian's stability and neatness!;0).

* <a href="http://racket-lang.org/">DrRacket</a>: This is one of those great things that may go unnoticed for decades. DrRacket is great environment to learn about computer programming and algorithms. it's not just a academic tool or even just a toy! it comes with batteries included(it has a great library for doing many common programming tasks). hmm... enough talk! just give it a try for yourself to find out(btw, don't miss the tutorial on how to build your own web server in Racket).    


  .... please wait while the rest of cool stuff is loading to be displayed;0) ....
