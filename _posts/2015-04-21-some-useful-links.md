title: Great things I've found
---

<span style="color:black; font-family:Sans; font-size:1.1em;">
I've just decided to share whatever I find interesting on the web with you people, actually there are tonnes of such stuff out there!, still some are more remarkable to me, so without further a due let me show you what I've found so far: </span>

  * <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian Operating System</a>: You may haven't heard of Debian but using Ubuntu or Kubuntu or Mint, it's just fine but have you ever wondered where and when and how everything that is has been started in the first place!??, plus on a personal level I love Debian's stability and neatness!;0).

  * <a href="http://racket-lang.org/">DrRacket</a>: This is one of those great things that may go unnoticed for decades. DrRacket is great environment to learn about computer programming and algorithms. it's not just a academic tool or even just a toy! it comes with batteries included(it has a great library for doing many common programming tasks). hmm... enough talk! just give it a try for yourself to find out(btw, don't miss the tutorial on how to build your own web server in Racket).
  
  * <a href="http://aosabook.org/en/index.html">Aosabook</a>: The Architecture of Open Source Applications are series of books(or maybe a book in multiple volumes, still separate books to me;0)) in which every chapter is written by creator(s) of a particular open source application and in each chapter authors explain how and why mostly they end up creating the application, how it's structured and in short how they managed to solve their problems via that application. it was really a good read for me to begin with so I guess it could be fun for you to read it(ok!, them!) too.

  * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_Contempt/">Time of Contempt</a>: It's a great book, I mean I love the way Andrzej Sapkowski(the author) twists and turns the story, also the characters especially Geralt and Yennefer aren't saints but save to some time it took me to get to the atmosphere of the world that the story happens in altogether it's really a good read!, I strongly suggest you give Witcher series of books(especially this one) a try!, btw books are a (wo)man's best friends!(besides diamonds and dogs of-course!;0)).

* <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">Hackers News</a>: Really a great great resource for someone interested in world of computers and wanted to be well informed of what's the top news out there.

* <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">XKCD 927</a>: NO!! I won't say anything this time, you just see for yourself!;0).
