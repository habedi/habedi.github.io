<h2>title: Great things on the web</h2>

<p>I've just decided to share whatever i find interesting on the web with other people, actually there are tonnes of such stuff out there!, still some are more remarkable to me, so without further a due let me show you what i've found so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian Operating System</a>: This may seem too trival to you but i see too many people using Ubuntu without noticing where and when and how everything that is has been started!, plus i love Debian's stability and neatness!;0)</li>
</ul>

<p>got back from the <a
href="http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013">2013 Bay
Area Erlang Factory</a>. This was my third time in SF and I had
a <i>great</i> time.</p>

<p><i>Great</i> is British English expression, I'm not sure how this translates into US
English, it's the superlative of the American word <i>awesome</i>. I asked
Mr. twitter what the superlative of <code>awesome'' was, the responses included
</code>bad ass'' (= <code>bad bottoms'' UK English) and words like</code>Dank'' and ``Tubular''.</p>

<p>It was great to meet old friends and make new friends, that's what I
like about the factories, it's the gossip and the talks and the side-events.</p>

<p>In my keynote I mentioned UBF (Universal Binary Format) which is near
to my heart. Unfortunately UBF is not widely used (which is a shame)
and a possible reason is the lack of publicity.</p>

<p>The subject of ``self-promotion'' has bubbled up occasionally on the
Erlang mailing list. Various users have described  Erlang folk as being
<i>appallingly bad</i> at promoting Erlang.  I have in various posts tried to
explain why this is so.</p>

<p>It's a cultural thing. In the far off snowy land from whence Erlang
originated self promotion is regarded with extreme suspicion. We (the
Erlang people) are actually quite proud of our work, but for us to say
that what we have done is good is a cardinal sin in Sweden and is
considered very bad manners.</p>

<p>It's OK for other people to say that what we have done is not-bad
(which we, of course, must vigorously deny) but for us to venture
the opinion that what we have done is good is considered at the
least a breach of etiquette and at most bragging (which is frowned
upon).</p>

<p>On the other side of the Atlantic this is not true. Here the
adjectives start at Awesome and exactly how to express more
appreciation than Awesome is a mystery to me.</p>

<p>I asked my American friends if saying that I thought that what we had
done was not bad would be perceived as bragging, or would attract
negative criticism. They ensured me that this was not the case and
that it was OK to shout it from the roofs.</p>

<p>So I think I'll change strategy. The old method was:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do some work</li>
<li>Publish on some website (say github)</li>
<li>Send a single post to the Erlang mailing list</li>
</ul>

<p>If nobody showed any interest, then I concluded that the project was a
failure and turned to some other problem.</p>

<p>Since I actually rather like UBF (I think it's better than Json and
XML) for example I remind people every ten years or so, so see if I
can raise a modicum of interest.</p>

<p>Now the worm has turned.</p>

<p>I'm starting a new blog. I'm going to tell you why Erlang is wicked
badd-ass awesome (translation: not-bad) and what's happening in the
Erlang world. I'll also talk about some other competing technologies
which I consider to be decidedly <i>Unawesome</i> and I'll tell you
why.</p>

<p>Stuff is happening. In two years time Erlang popularity will explode.
In a series of blog posts I'll tell you why.</p>

<p>In the next few posts I'll retroactively blog about what happened
at the Erlang factory. This is behind the scenes stuff. What really
happened in San Francisco?</p>
