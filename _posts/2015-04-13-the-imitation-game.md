title: The Imitation Game
---

I've just finished watching "the imitation game" the recent film about the life of Alan P. Turing, who's famous for his idea of universal computaion machines(a.k.a Turing machines) and the so called "Church-Turing thesis". as someone who likes "Informatiks/Computer science" i'm quite happy with the whole portrayal of Turing, yet it baffles me how good chronicles of someone's life as Turing could be used to show a typical romance, i mean relationship between Joan Clarke and Turing is shown as if it's somehthing like what went through between Freddie Mercury and Mary Austin!, no sir!!, i can't buy it!!, Turing was a homosexual then the movie's highest point of this was when young Turing heared the news of death of his beloved friend because of bovine turbocholosis! i mean it's 2015 but it seems it's hard create a film that could collect a lot of audience being about personal affairs of a homosexual.



  .... please wait i'm not finished writing ....
