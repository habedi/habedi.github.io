summary: The Imitation Game Film 
---

I've just finished watching "the imitation game" the recent film about the life of Alan P. Turing, who's famous for his idea of universal computation machines(a.k.a Turing machines) and the so called "Church-Turing thesis" and also one of founding fathers of Artificial Intelligence. first things first, as someone who likes and been a student of "Informatiks/Computer science" i'm quite happy with the whole portrayal of Turing, Benedict Cumberbatch is an amazing actor, he can mesmerize you with his deep blue eyes and timely impressions. also i like the way the story is told, i mean first scene starts by showing police investigating somewhat like a breakthrough into Turing's home that's been reported not by him but by one of neighbours. as the story progresses you know more about the man and how the movie makers wanted him to be looked like. oh, as i'm aware now Turing was a great runner!, a fact many including me weren't aware of!;0). 


Nevertheless it baffles me how good chronicles of someone's life as Turing could be used to show a typical romance, i mean relationship between Joan Clarke and Turing is shown as if it's something like what went through between Freddie Mercury and Mary Austin!, no sir!!, i can't buy it!!, Turing was a homosexual! then the movie's highest point of this aspect was when young Turing heard the news of death of his beloved friend because of bovine tuberculosis and you could see the sadness in his face!!. it maybe the year 2015 yet it seems hard to create a film that collects a lot of audience being about personal affairs of a homosexual. the other annoying part for me was that in the film Turing is shown as a kinda mentally unstable prodigy whom behaviour deviates too much of an ordinary man of that era! it's really hard to believe, i mean why you should look like a lunatic to be considered someone who can have a great effect on your world!??.


As a last word, i strongly suggest to everybody to have a look at Turing's seminal article that the name of the film is taken from. you can read it online from <a href="http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/TuringArticle.html">The Imitation Game</a>. it argues for the first time many ideas that are crucial for existence of field of AI, things like what is a thinking machine!? and what we may need to make one!.
