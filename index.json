My main research interests are query processing and data mining of spatio-textual datasets, and database tools and technologies.\nI am part of the Trondheim Analytica (TA) project, which is a collaboration between different NTNU departments for processing and analysing data from social platforms like Twitter and Facebook.\nMy current research is focused on efficient processing and data mining of spatio-textual data. The sheer amount of the data, the complexity associated with different components of the data\u0026ndash;i.e. the presence of a mixture of text, spatial and temporal information\u0026ndash;makes it challenging to work with the spatio-textual data. The primary aim of my research is to propose and develop more efficient and accurate methods and algorithms to handle the intricacies of the data generated on different location-based social networks such as Twitter.\nIf you see an opportunity for collaboration, please, do not hesitate to contact me. :Ã˜)\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://habedi.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a PhD candidate in Data and Artificial Intelligence group (DART) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).
